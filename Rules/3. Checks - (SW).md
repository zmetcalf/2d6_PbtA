Basic Check: 
* Roll 1d6 action die and a 1d6 wild die - Success on 4+ on one die
	* Raises on multiples of 4 (8, 12, 16)
	* Dice explode and can create raises when 6's are rolled
		* Roll individual 6's and add the together
		* Can be raised until a non-six is rolled
* Aces only get a wild die (second d6)
* Regular characters only get a single d6
* Critical fail if all rolled dice are ones

Opposed Check:
* Roll 1d6 action die and if ace, additionally roll 1d6 wild die
* Must achieve minimum success (4+) 
* Defender must meet or exceed to be successful. 

D20 Lovers:
* The basic check for an ace can be simulated with a D20 by using this chart:
	* Extremely Successful - Natural 20 (2+ raises)
	* Very Successful - 16+ (1 raise)
	* Successful - 6+ (0 raises)
	* Fail - 2-5
	* Total Fail - Natural 1
