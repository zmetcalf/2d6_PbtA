With this system, there is no player sheet. A character is as complex the player would like to make them within the fiction. All the checks and combat moves are setup so that fiction reigns king. Want to conjure a spell to fire a massive fireball at a door, roll a check. Want to punch someone in the face, roll a combat attack. Focus on fiction, not stats. 

Players have three states: normal, shaken, and wounded. (Can be shaken and wounded) This state can easily tracked over the board or notes.
